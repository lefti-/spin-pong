Sping Pong
----------

What?
-----
This repo contains Spin Pong - a spin-off of Pong (pun intended)! A game I developed as my first serious game project. 
It is programmed in C#, using SFML (with C#-bindings) and Box2D (with C#-bindings).

- SFML is used for handling input, graphics, audio, windowing and text
- Box2D is used for collision detection and resposnse

Projects:
---------
sping-pong : A full playable game with gameplay similar to Pong.  Five different difficulty options. 
             Graphics created in paint.net. Sounds found from the internet.

How to play?
----------
The ball speeds up at a constant rate. You may notice that the AI is almost impossible to defeat. 
This is where the "Spin" from "Spin Pong" comes into play. When you hit the ball, move your 
mouse in the same direction the ball is going in. This is the key to winning !
